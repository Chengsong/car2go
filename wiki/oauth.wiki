= Access protected functions via OAuth =
Some API functions are marked as protected. You need to authenticate via OAuth to access these functions.


See [http://www.oauth.net oauth.net] for more details on OAuth.


As a developer you must register as a so called "consumer" at car2go. See [oauth#Registration_as_consumer registration] for more details.

== Restrictions ==
  * Use HMAC-SHA1 for signing requests.
  * We ignore callback URLs passed to request token endpoint. You may provide a callback URL during registration as a consumer.
  * Access to car2go API is limited to a few calls per second (see [oauth#Error_codes Error Codes]). Keep this in mind during development of your application.


== OAuth Endpoints ==

|| Get access token || https://www.car2go.com/api/accesstoken || Token is valid for about one month. User can revoke token via car2go portal. ||
